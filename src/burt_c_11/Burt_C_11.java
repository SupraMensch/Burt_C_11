// Christopher Burt
// Project # 11

//Write a Customer class that contains the following fields:

//- Name
//- Customer ID
//- Address
//- Phone Number

//The class should have two constructors:
//- A no-arg constructor that sets the fields to empty strings ("")
//- A constructor that accepts the four fields as arguments and assigns them to their appropriate fields in the class

//Write appropriate mutator methods to store values in the fields and accessor methods to return the values in the fields.

//Write a separate program that creates three Customer objects by entering the fields for each object from the keyboard.
